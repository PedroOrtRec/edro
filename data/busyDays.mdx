# Busy Days

These days I didn't have time to write a small .mdx document. I've been working on my final project together with my partner (we're making an expense sharing app called mySlice). Soon we will have to show it. In the meantime, I've been researching FreeCodeCamp and doing the basic javaScript exercises there. I looked at documentation on Chart.js for creating charts and talked to some friends about starting projects for my portfolio. There are many things to do and little time!
