# Hi

Hello good. Let me introduce myself, my name is Pedro and I am a junior web developer. I created this blog on nextjs (cheating a bit) to write about my learning process. Today is the last day of the web development bootcamp at Immune Technology Institute where I have been studying for the last five months. Now begins a period in which I will be doing the final project of the course, while I try to find my first job as a developer. I will try to improve the blog over time. Remember, you always have to think that the best in life is about to begin. Talk to you soon!
